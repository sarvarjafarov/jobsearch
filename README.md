## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Deploying to Vercel

Vercel’s serverless functions mount your project in a read-only filesystem, so Laravel cannot write compiled views, cache files, or logs to `storage/` by default. Without additional configuration the platform returns a `500` error similar to `file_put_contents(.../storage/framework/views/xxx.php): Failed to open stream: Permission denied`. The bootstrap file now auto-detects a read-only storage directory and falls back to `/tmp/laravel-storage`, but it’s still best to pin that path via an environment variable so you know exactly where runtime files live.

To run this project on Vercel:

1. Define the environment variables shown in `.env.vercel` inside the Vercel dashboard (or via `vercel env`). Setting `APP_STORAGE=/tmp/storage` overrides the fallback path and ensures every runtime uses the same writable directory. Keep `LOG_CHANNEL=stderr`, `CACHE_STORE=array`, `SESSION_DRIVER=cookie`, and `QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync` so no other disk writes are attempted.
2. Supply your production credentials (database, mail, Google Indexing, etc.) in the same place—do **not** commit real secrets to source control.
3. Deploy normally with `vercel --prod`. The existing `scripts/vercel-build.sh` takes care of installing Composer dependencies, caching config, and building the front-end assets.

If you ever need a local .env for Vercel-style testing, copy `.env.vercel` to `.env` and fill in the secrets before running `php artisan config:cache`.
